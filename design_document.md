# Special Needs Student Self-Advocacy Tool

## Project Overview
This application aims to help students practice and improve their self-advocacy skills. The tool will be installed on student devices, allowing them to train the application according to their preferences and run through self-advocacy scenarios.

## Core Requirements
1. Student-centered application that can be loaded on individual devices
2. Ability to train the app to remember student preferences
3. Scenario-based learning with at least three self-advocacy scenarios
4. Track how well the application remembers and applies student preferences

## Key Features
1. **User Profile System**
   - Create and manage student profiles
   - Store preferences and settings

2. **Preference Training**
   - Interface for students to set their preferences
   - Machine learning component to recognize patterns
   - Storage of preference data

3. **Self-Advocacy Scenarios**
   - Interactive scenarios for students to practice skills
   - Feedback mechanism based on choices
   - Progress tracking

4. **Adaptability**
   - Application adapts based on learned preferences
   - Difficulty adjustment based on student progress

## Technology Considerations
- Platform: Web-based or native application?
- Accessibility features for various special needs
- Data privacy and security for student information
- Offline functionality

## Next Steps
1. Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders
2. Develop wireframes for user interface
3. Create prototype of core functionality
4. Test with representative users
5. Refine based on feedback

## Demo Plan
Develop a working prototype in time for the June seminar that demonstrates:
- User profile creation
- Preference training
- At least one complete self-advocacy scenario
